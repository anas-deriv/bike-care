# Remote Repository

## Purpose
Remote repositories are responsible for interacting with external data sources or services, often over a network or API. These sources could be databases, web services, external APIs, or any data that resides outside of the application.

## Characteristic
- Deals with external data sources.
- Handles network communication (e.g., making HTTP requests to a REST API).
- Converts data between the application's format and the external data source's format.
- May involve authentication and authorization to access the remote data.

## Example
In a mobile app, a remote repository might be responsible for fetching user data from a remote server using HTTP requests.
