# Local Repository

## Purpose
Local repositories deal with data storage and retrieval within the application itself. They abstract away the specific storage mechanisms (e.g., databases, file systems) and provide an interface for the application to read and write data locally.

## Characteristic
- Manages data persistence within the application.
- Handles local data storage and retrieval, such as SQLite databases, SharedPreferences, or local files.
- Provides an abstraction layer to decouple the application from the underlying storage technology.
- Typically used for caching and improving data access performance.

## Example
In a mobile app, a local repository might be responsible for storing and retrieving cached images or user preferences.
